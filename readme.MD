# rest-api-under-proxy
Complete name : Twitter REST request under proxy. 

I made some hacks using [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) with [http API](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) to pass proxy boundary when playing with twitter api.
In the near future, I might write how it comes on my blog. 

Hope this helps.
